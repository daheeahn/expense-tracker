### For Developer!

1. When you try to apply custom variables in `tailwind.config.js`, you need to execute command below.

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./css/input.css -o ./css/output.css --watch
```

2. We have two screen versions: mobile and desktop. Please apply the desktop layout for screens larger than `lg` (as per [Tailwind's responsive design documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design)).
